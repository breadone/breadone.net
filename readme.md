My personal website, built on [Astro](https://astro.build/). It's a work in progress, but I like what's on there already.

I write and take photos mostly, and I'll add more stuff as i think of it :)

On the technical side, it's hosted on an Oracle Cloud Compute instance using Docker and all custom configured networking using nginx.

The content (posts, photos, etc) is managed via a custom CMS I made using Pocketbase, and the heathclipped service is a very legally grey web-scraper hosted using an AWS Lambda.
