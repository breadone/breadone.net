My personal website, built on [Astro](https://astro.build/). It's a little bit decrepit.

Also featuring photos I take, trying to be a proper photographer.

The heathclipped tab is a very legally grey image scraper for the comic series Heathcliff. I'm still not sure why I made that, but it's funny i think
