My personal website, built on [Astro](https://astro.build/), exciting new V3 version that's largely the same visually, but under the hood a LOT more efficient, scalable, and self-hostable.

It's still in a lot of flux, as I'm still rethinking a lot of processes for all the content I've been putting on it. I'm happy (enough) with how it is now though, so it's hopefully a fun enough look.
