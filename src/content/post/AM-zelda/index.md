this is very possibly the first post here and will probably not be the most stupid but it's a great start isn't it!!

so my thesis statement is my (VERY SUBJECTIVE) comparison between the *The Legend of Zelda* entries, *Breath of the Wild* (2017) and *Tears of the Kingdom* (2023) is damn near identical to my (EXTREMELY!! SUBJECTIVE) comparison between two of the albums by the Arctic Monkeys, *Tranquility Base Hotel and Casino* (2018) and *The Car* (2022).

the earlier of both being personal actual genre shattering revelations in their own areas and while both started out as not rlly clicking, ended up as my absolute favourite entry in their respective genres (arctic monkey albums and games)

the latter of both being undeniable improvements to their predecessors in multiple ways and deservedly loved by fans even more by said predecessors, but i personally like less because theyre generally less cohesive of an experience and can fall victim to being compared to (near) perfection
(or actual perfection for tbhc like oh my GOD what an album)
