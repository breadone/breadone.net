what a title right, but the more i think about it, the more sense it makes? if you know the digital camera game up until the early-mid 2010s, it was basically just pushing up against the laws of physics. you had a bigger sensor, with better photoreceptors, you were (saving for things like colour science) gonna have the better camera. 

but then we started to cram cameras into our phones, and we started to take those *really* seriously. a 2 megapixel camera that could just about make out the colour blue and maybe the person you're taking a photo of wasn't gonna cut it anymore.

with the introduction of the iphone 5s in 2013, apple introduced the world to high dynamic range photography, or hdr for short. you can think of dynamic range as the difference between the light and dark areas of an image, and generally, 

now to be clear, this was not a new concept in photography by any means.
traditionally, you would set up a camera on a tripod, and take multiple photos, each at a different exposure (brightness) level. then, either through software, or in the case of film photography, chemically, combining those multiple photos to produce one image
