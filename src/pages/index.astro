			<p>
				hi! welcome to this (still very much work in progress) lil web site!
			</p><br>
			<p>
				this place started as a very very simple little thing that i made on a whim, but as i learned more and wanted to do more here, i eventually caved and made An Proper Website.
				you can still visit <a class="cactus-link" href="/throwback">the old place</a> tho! 
			</p><br>
			<p>
				i've tried my best to stick with what i set out to do with the original project,
				which basically boiled down to not make this place too boring. 
			</p><br>
			<p>
				but yeah, i've been uploading more photos to here, as well as trying to write a little,
				as a treat, whenever i have ideas. i'll certainly keep updating this place whenever i can too!
